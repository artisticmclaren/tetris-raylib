# Tetris in raylib
I decided to learn C and raylib by making tetris.

# Build Instructions

### Windows
1. get and install w64devkit (tutorial on the raylib "working with windows" part of the wiki)
2. open w64devkit.exe
3. cd into whatever folder this is downloaded into
4. run bash wincompile.sh

### Linux
1. download and compile raylib into ~
2. git clone this repo into anywhere
3. cd into this repo (usually cd tetris-raylib)
4. run bash compile.sh
